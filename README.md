Things I learned about UPES
## These are the things I have figured out about my college campus
- The campus is on the next level compared to any other
- It has a jet🛩️, a tank and a museum🦴
- The field it has makes me feel like a pro
- The logo is really nice ![logo](https://github.com/vedmahajan-code/Images/blob/main/IMG-20250729-WA0105.jpg)
- The mess is way better than expected and can turn me into a professional eater
- Gym over here has the ability to turn me into Eddy Hall
- Has containers to study in
## School of CS
- faculty keeps you on toes throughout the lecture
- Interesting blend of youth and experience
- It has its own servers
- The place gives you the feel of corporate office
